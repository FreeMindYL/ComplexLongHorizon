# ✨ VLM-Knowledge-Graph-Integration-in-Complex-Long-Horizon-Tasks
### Leveraging VLMs and Knowledge Graphs for Complex Long-Horizon Embodied Tasks

---

## 📌 Project Introduction
This project explores the integration of **VLM (Vision-Language Model) + Knowledge Graph** in **complex long-horizon tasks**.
By constructing a callable scene knowledge structure, the agent gains stronger interpretability and robustness in environmental perception, semantic understanding, task decomposition, and planning and execution.

---
## 🚀 Core Features
- 🔍 **Enhanced VLM Scene Understanding**: Modeling the attributes, states, and semantics of objects in the environment
- 🧠 **Knowledge Graph Assisted Decision Making**: Structurally expressing object relationships and spatial dependencies and participating in reasoning
- 🤖 **Embodied Agent Execution**: Enabling long-sequence execution for tasks such as grasping, navigation, and interaction
- 🔄 **Modularity**: Modular structure supports custom tasks, KG rules, and processing logic

### **2️⃣ Task with one blocking object**
Instruction: "Place the green card in the box, and put the lid in front of the initial card."

### **3️⃣ Task with multiple spatial constraints, and multiple objects**
Instruction: "Take the charger out of the box, put the card in, and put the cover on."

### **4️⃣Task exploring unseen object and position memory requirements**
Instruction: "Place the cards from the box on top of the charger, and remember to put the cover afterwards."
